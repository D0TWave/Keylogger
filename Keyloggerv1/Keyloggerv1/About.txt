GetAsyncKeystate:
	if (GetAsyncKeyState(key) & 0x8000) { 
	used to be
	if (GetAsyncKeyState(key) == -32767) { 
	Now the -32767 is the decimal version of 0x8000 so with GetAsyncKeyState 0x8000 means the key is pressed down. 
	-32767 = 1000 0000 0000 0001 and that means if it returns that number it says it was pressed and released at the same time.
	So if you single out the thing we want (was it pressed) we have a hex value 0x8000
	BUT
	if you do that it will print the key multiple times depending on how long it was held
	so if you use the release key and the press key at the same time it will only output or print 1 of the keys.
TLDR;
	Says if the key is being pressed do something.

HEX AND ASCII:
	Because Downkey has no ascii they added one in. SO you need to use the hex value as every key has a hex value and cant be overwritten/overlapping
